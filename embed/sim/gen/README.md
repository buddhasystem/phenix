# Instructions

It is assumed that the home directory of the user contains "install/lib" and the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is aware of it.

Also, the GSL library must be included and point to the official build, for example the current directory may contain libgsl.so.0 -> /opt/phenix/core/gsl/lib/libgsl.so
