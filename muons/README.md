# What's here?
This repo is not meant for self-contained functional code st this point (although this is the eventual goal).
It's primary role is to support documentation currently kept in the Phenix Offline Wiki. Most of the materials
were transferred from the original project:

   /gpfs02/phenix/fvtx/subsys/fvtx/ajeeta/Simulation

# Caveat Emptor
Please note that the material here may contain modifications needed for basic testing, where appropriate the scripts will contain the signage "-mxp-" to mark the code locations where (obvious) changes were made.
